# docker-statistics-collector

A lightweight service that connects to the Docker Engine API, collects container
information and runtime statistics (CPU, memory), and aggregates Prometheus
metrics exposed by containers running under `docker compose`.

## Workspace layout

- [docker-sdk/](docker-sdk/) — a minimal async client for the Docker Engine
  HTTP API (list containers, fetch container stats).
- [docker-statistics-collector/](docker-statistics-collector/) — the collector
  service: background timers, in-memory caches, an HTTP/Swagger API, and an
  MCP (Model Context Protocol) endpoint at `/mcp`.

## How it works

Two timers run every 5 seconds:

1. **Containers sync** — calls the Docker Engine API to list containers and,
   for each running container, fetches runtime stats. CPU usage, memory usage,
   available memory, memory limit, the number of open file descriptors and the
   `nofile` limit are stored in an in-memory cache. See
   [sync_containers_info_timer.rs](docker-statistics-collector/src/timers/sync_containers_info_timer.rs).
   File-descriptor stats require the host `/proc` to be mounted — see
   [File descriptor statistics](#file-descriptor-statistics).
2. **Metrics sync** — for every container that carries the
   `com.docker.compose.service` label, the collector scrapes
   `http://<service_name>:<metrics_port>/metrics`. If the response looks like
   Prometheus text format, an `app="<service_name>"` label is injected into
   every metric line and the payload is stored in the metrics cache. See
   [sync_metrics_endpoints_timer.rs](docker-statistics-collector/src/timers/sync_metrics_endpoints_timer.rs).

The HTTP server listens on port `8000` and exposes a Swagger UI. See
[start_up.rs](docker-statistics-collector/src/http/start_up.rs).

## HTTP endpoints

- `GET /containers` — list of containers with their state, image, ports, volumes
  and usage snapshot (CPU, memory, and a `files` block with open file descriptors
  and the `nofile` limit).
- `GET /containers/running` — only running containers.
- `GET /containers/logs` — container logs.
- `GET /containers/processes` — every process inside one container with its
  open file descriptors and `nofile` limit (federation-aware, like logs).
- `GET /metrics` — aggregated Prometheus metrics from all scraped services.
- `GET /metrics/services` — list of services that have collected metrics.
- `GET /metrics/service` — metrics for a single service.

Controller sources: [containers_controller/](docker-statistics-collector/src/http/controllers/containers_controller/),
[metrics_controller/](docker-statistics-collector/src/http/controllers/metrics_controller/).

## Configuration

Settings are read from `~/.docker-statistics-collector` (YAML). See
[settings.rs](docker-statistics-collector/src/settings.rs).

| Field                        | Type           | Description                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docker_url`                 | `string`       | Docker Engine API endpoint. TCP: `http://localhost:2375`. Unix socket: `http+unix://var/run/docker.sock`. |
| `metrics_port`               | `u16`          | Port on which each service exposes its Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint.            |
| `disable_metics_collecting`  | `bool?`        | If `true`, the metrics scraping timer is a no-op.                                 |
| `services_to_ignore`         | `list<string>?`| Optional. `com.docker.compose.service` values to skip during scraping.            |
| `peers`                      | `list<string>?`| Optional. Base URLs of peer collector instances to federate with (see below).     |
| `peers_sync_interval_secs`   | `u64?`         | Optional. Interval for polling peers. Default `5`.                                |
| `peers_request_timeout_secs` | `u64?`         | Optional. Per-peer request timeout. Default `5`.                                  |
| `host_proc_path`             | `string?`      | Optional. Path inside the collector container where the host `/proc` is mounted. Used to read per-container open file descriptors and `nofile` limits. Default `/host/proc`. See [File descriptor statistics](#file-descriptor-statistics). |

Example:

```yaml
docker_url: http://localhost:2375
metrics_port: 9091
disable_metics_collecting: false
services_to_ignore:
  - nginx
  - redis
peers:
  - http://collector-b:8000
  - http://collector-c:8000
peers_sync_interval_secs: 5
peers_request_timeout_secs: 5
# Path where the host `/proc` is mounted inside the collector container.
# Default is `/host/proc` — see "File descriptor statistics" below for the
# required `-v /proc:/host/proc:ro` volume mount.
host_proc_path: /host/proc
```

The HTTP listen port (`8000`) is hardcoded in
[start_up.rs](docker-statistics-collector/src/http/start_up.rs).

The optional `ENV_INFO` environment variable is surfaced via the app context.

## Build and run

Locally:

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/docker-statistics-collector
```

In Docker — see [Dockerfile](Dockerfile):

```bash
cargo build --release
docker build -t docker-statistics-collector .
docker run --rm \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v /proc:/host/proc:ro \
  -v $HOME/.docker-statistics-collector:/root/.docker-statistics-collector \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  docker-statistics-collector
# ^ the -v /proc:/host/proc:ro mount is REQUIRED for the per-container
#   file-descriptor stats (Files: open/limit, leak graph, Processes dialog).
#   Without it the `files` block in the API and the UI just shows N/A.
```

The `-v /proc:/host/proc:ro` mount is what makes the per-container
file-descriptor stats work — see [File descriptor statistics](#file-descriptor-statistics).

Minimal `docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  docker-statistics-collector:
    image: ghcr.io/myjettools/docker-statistics-collector:0.2.5
    container_name: docker-statistics-collector
    restart: always
    environment:
    - ENV_INFO
    volumes:
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    # REQUIRED for the per-container file-descriptor stats (Files: open/limit,
    # leak graph, Processes dialog). Without this the `files` block is N/A.
    - /proc:/host/proc:ro
    - ./.docker-statistics-collector:/root/.docker-statistics-collector:ro
```

To use a Unix socket, set `docker_url: http+unix://var/run/docker.sock` and
keep the `/var/run/docker.sock` bind-mount (read-only is enough). For TCP,
drop the socket mount and point `docker_url` at the daemon's HTTP endpoint.

## File descriptor statistics

For every running container the collector reports **how many file descriptors
its main process currently has open** and that process's **`nofile` soft
limit** (`RLIMIT_NOFILE`). The "main process" is the one started by the image
`ENTRYPOINT`/`CMD` — PID 1 inside the container. `RLIMIT_NOFILE` is enforced
per process, so this is the process whose `open / limit` ratio actually matters.

In the UI each container shows a `Files: <open>/<limit>` line — colour-coded
green / orange / red as it approaches the limit — and an open-files **history
graph** next to the CPU/memory graphs: a steadily climbing line is a
file-descriptor leak. The values are also in the `files` block of
`GET /containers`.

The container's **Processes** button opens a dialog listing every process
inside the container with its own open file descriptors and `nofile` limit
(busiest process first) — useful for pinning down which process leaks. It is
backed by `GET /containers/processes` and computed on demand from
`docker top` + the host `/proc`.

File descriptors are a *per-process* kernel resource — the Docker Engine API
does not expose them. The collector obtains them by reading the host `/proc`:
for each container it gets the main process PID from `docker inspect`
(`/containers/{id}/json` → `State.Pid`), then counts `<proc>/<pid>/fd` and reads
the `Max open files` line of `<proc>/<pid>/limits`.

### Paths to mount into the collector container

Because the collector runs inside Docker, the host `/proc` must be made visible
to it. **Mount it as a volume** — this is the single extra path required, on top
of the Docker socket:

| Host path | Mount inside the container | Mode        | Why                                              |
| --------- | -------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `/proc`   | `/host/proc`               | `ro` (read) | Per-container open file descriptors and `nofile` limits |

```yaml
volumes:
- /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
- /proc:/host/proc:ro
- ./.docker-statistics-collector:/root/.docker-statistics-collector:ro
```

The mount point is configurable via the `host_proc_path` setting (default
`/host/proc`). The bind-mounted `/proc` carries the host's process table, so the
host PIDs returned by Docker resolve correctly. The collector must run as `root`
(the default) to read `<proc>/<pid>/fd` of processes owned by other users.

**Alternative — `pid: host`.** Instead of the volume mount you can give the
collector the host PID namespace; then its own `/proc` already shows host
processes and you set `host_proc_path: /proc`:

```yaml
pid: host
```

### When the stats are unavailable

`files.open` / `files.limit` stay `null` (UI shows `N/A`) when the host `/proc`
cannot be read — i.e. the volume is not mounted, the Docker daemon is on a
**remote** host (`docker_url` points elsewhere), or the platform has no `/proc`
(e.g. running the collector on macOS for development). This is non-fatal: CPU and
memory stats keep working regardless.

## Federation

When `peers` is set in the master collector's settings, every request that needs
cross-host data **fans out to peers in real time** (parallel HTTP calls,
`peers_request_timeout_secs` per call, default 5s). There is no peer cache and
no sync timer — adding/removing peers in the YAML is picked up on the next
request.

- `GET /api/containers` and `GET /api/containers/running` return the union of
  local containers and a real-time fan-out to every peer's
  `/api/containers/local`. Each item carries an `instance` field naming the
  source's `ENV_INFO`. Failed peers are logged to stderr and skipped
  (best-effort merge).
- `GET /api/containers/logs?id=...&lines_number=...` tries the local Docker
  socket first; if the id is unknown locally it broadcasts the log fetch to all
  peers in parallel and returns the first 200 response.
- `GET /api/containers/local` is the **peer-facing** endpoint — local data only,
  never re-fanouts. This makes A↔B reciprocal peering safe (no recursion).
- The `/mcp` tools behave the same way — searches and log retrieval span the
  fleet through the master.
- `/metrics` aggregation across peers is **not** federated in this version.

## MCP endpoint

The collector exposes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) endpoint at `POST /mcp`
on the same port (`8000`). Three tools are exposed: `list_servers_and_services`,
`find_containers`, `get_container_logs`. All federation-aware.

See [MCP.md](MCP.md) for the full guide — endpoint, tool schemas, response
shapes, client registration, sample tool-call flows, and notes on extending the
server.

Quick client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "docker-statistics": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Requirements

- Rust (edition 2021).
- Access to a Docker Engine API endpoint.
- Scraped services must expose Prometheus text-format metrics on
  `/metrics` at the configured `metrics_port`.
